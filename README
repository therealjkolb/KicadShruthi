# **About this project** 

Shruthi-1, a digital/analog hybrid MIDI monosynth.

This project is a port of the Shruthi-1 Design into Kicad for current manufacturing, as well as addressing component obsolecence within the design.

Primary goal of the project is to take the exiting Eagle based design files and move them to Kicad. The project is to build the Digital XT control board as well
as the SMR4mk-II filter board only.

Inherited files that are not to be remanufactured removed for cleanliness, but design files relevant to the Digital XT and the SMR4mk-II are being retained.

# **Firmware Changes** 
- 3-17-2024 -- Will Kolb(wfkolb@gmail.com)
    - Changed debounce settings to add stability in ui.cc
    - Determined that building with avr-gcc 4.3.3 is the **ONLY** way to have successful page navigation. (Added a comment to editor.cc to show the failure point for other compilers)
    - Updated dsp/Makefile to point to the proper mcu (644p)
    

# **Code/Asset Licenses** 

The firmware is (still) released under a GPL3.0 license. It includes a
reimplementation of the formant synthesis algorithm used in Peter Knight's
Cantarino speech synthesizer.

The PCB layouts and schematics (in /hardware/shruthi/design/pcb)
are released under a Creative Commons cc-by-sa 3.0 license 

Only the SMR4_MkII_V03 Filter board is contained in this project.
And the Digital XT filter board, both developed In Kicad 6.

Documentation, analyses, simulations and 3D models are released under a
